                <p>We are a husband and wife coaching team in the sport of figure skating.  I, <a href="coaches.html">Laurent Masse</a> and my wife <a href="coaches.html">Heidi</a>
                have been coaching in the Traverse City area for over 20 years.  We have had the pleasure to work with so many people
                in our community and from across the country.  I grew up in the Boston, MA. area, where I trained with many great coaches and skaters.
                Heidi grew up in California where she too had the opportunity to train with high level athletes and coaches.  We enjoy coaching all skaters, no matter what their goals are.
                The skills in skating can be beneficial for a lifetime, and our aim is to be able to share that with our skaters.  You can learn more about our bios on the <a href="coaches.html"> coaches</a>
                page.<br>  I moved to Traverse City, MI in 1999 just after graduating from college.  I was not a skating coach at the time, but moved here because I 
                had attended my best friends wedding here and fell in love with the area.  I later began coaching as a temporary way to earn an income.  20+ years later, I am still at it.  
                <br> Heidi moved here from Massachusettes where she had begun coaching in 2001.  She too had visited the area and decided she was going to 
                try to stay in the area for some time and start coaching in Traverse City.</p>
